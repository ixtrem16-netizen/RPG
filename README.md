# Three.js Quaternius Studio

> **Work in progress** — things may be incomplete, change without notice, or break unexpectedly.
> Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome — feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!

A collection of browser-based tools for working with **[Quaternius](https://quaternius.com)** 3D assets in Three.js.
No build step, no bundler — runs entirely in the browser.

> **3D assets (Quaternius) are not included** — see the Setup section below.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — Studio.exe (recommended)

A standalone launcher is available — **no Node.js or Python required** on the target machine.

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ixtrem16-netizen/RPG.git
cd RPG
```

**2. Download the Quaternius assets** — see [Required Assets](#setup--required-assets) below.

**3. Build the launcher** *(one-time, requires Node.js)*
```bash
npx pkg . --target node18-win-x64 --output Studio.exe --compress GZip
```

**4. Launch**

Double-click `Studio.exe` — the browser opens on the hub automatically.

> `Studio.exe` (~36 MB) embeds the Node.js runtime. It only needs to be rebuilt if `server.js` changes.
> The `.exe` is excluded from the repository (`.gitignore`) — each developer builds their own copy.

---

### Option B — Local server (any OS)

```bash
npx serve . -p 3000
```
Then open **http://localhost:3000** in Chrome or Firefox.

> Any static file server works. Alternatively:
> ```bash
> python -m http.server 3000
> ```

---

## Navigation

Every tool page has a **`≡` button** (bottom-right corner) that opens a quick-switch menu to jump between tools without going back to the hub.
